Add a hero slideshow to any sidebar and display it with Tyler Smith's Flexslider. To use this plugin you must first install Space Manager.

== Description ==

Wordpress' built-in Text widget is great, but it's not all that user-friendly. Now you can use FlexSlider Space Manager to use the Tiny MCE editor that you're familiar with to create "Slides" and organize them into "Slideshows". You can then drop these Slideshows into any sidebar.

== Installation ==

1. Download and activate the [Space Manager](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/space-manager/ "Download Space Manager")
1. Activate the Flexslider Manager plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Under the Settings menu click on "Flexslider Manager"
1. Create a "Zone"
1. Create a "Space"
1. Under the Appearance menu click on "Widgets"
1. Drag the "Flexslider Manager" widget to a sidebar
